# Buying Signals vs Intent Data: What's the Difference and Why It Matters

Sales teams throw around "intent data" and "buying signals" like they're the same thing. They're not. Confusing them costs pipeline.

## Intent Data: The Research Phase

Intent data captures that someone is *researching* a topic. It's broad and early-stage:

- A company's employees are reading articles about "CRM migration"
- Someone downloaded a whitepaper on sales automation
- Website visits to your pricing page from a specific IP range
- Content consumption patterns across third-party review sites

Intent data says: *"This company is thinking about a problem you solve."*

It's useful for **awareness** and **targeting** — knowing who to put in front of your message. But it doesn't tell you when to pick up the phone.

## Buying Signals: The Decision Phase

Buying signals are concrete actions that indicate a prospect is actively moving toward a purchase:

- Posting on social media asking for tool recommendations
- Engaging with competitor content (likes, comments, shares)
- Job postings that indicate a new initiative (e.g., "Hiring Sales Operations Manager")
- Contract renewal dates approaching
- Recent funding announcements
- Direct comparison searches ("Tool A vs Tool B")
- Engaging with your content multiple times in a short window

Buying signals say: *"This person is ready to evaluate and decide — now."*

## Why the Distinction Matters

**Timing is everything in sales.** Reaching out during the research phase with a hard pitch feels pushy. Reaching out during the decision phase with helpful context feels timely.

Here's the framework:

| Signal Type | Stage | Best Action |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Intent data | Awareness | Add to nurture sequence, serve targeted content |
| Weak buying signal | Consideration | Personalized outreach, educational content |
| Strong buying signal | Decision | Direct outreach, demo offer, case study |

Most sales teams only work with one or the other. The real advantage comes from layering them: intent data for targeting, buying signals for timing.

## The Problem with Traditional Intent Data

Third-party intent data providers aggregate behavior across publisher networks. The data is:

- **Delayed** — often 7-14 days old by the time you see it
- **Noisy** — a single employee reading an article ≠ company-wide intent
- **Expensive** — enterprise intent platforms run $30K-100K/year
- **Commoditized** — your competitors get the same signals

When everyone acts on the same Bombora or G2 intent data, you're not getting an edge — you're joining a crowd.

## Social Buying Signals: The Untapped Channel

The highest-value buying signals in 2026 are happening on social media, in public:

- Reddit posts: "What's the best alternative to [competitor]?"
- LinkedIn posts: "We just secured Series A, looking to build out our sales stack"
- Twitter/X: "Frustrated with [tool], anyone have recommendations?"
- Community forums: Direct product comparison discussions

These are **real-time, high-intent, and visible** — but almost nobody is systematically capturing them. The signal-to-noise ratio is brutal if you're searching manually.

## How to Build a Signal-Based Sales Process

1. **Define your trigger events** — What specific actions indicate someone needs what you sell?
2. **Set up monitoring** — Track social platforms, job boards, news, and communities for these triggers
3. **Score and prioritize** — Not all signals are equal. A product comparison post beats a general industry article
4. **Respond fast** — Social buying signals decay rapidly. A Reddit post asking for recommendations gets answered within hours
5. **Lead with value** — Don't pitch. Share relevant experience, case studies, or genuine help

The shift from "spray and pray" to signal-based selling isn't just more effective — it's more respectful of your prospects' time.

## The Bottom Line

Intent data answers: "Who might be interested?"
Buying signals answer: "Who is ready to act?"

The best sales teams in 2026 use both. They use intent data to build their universe, and buying signals to decide when and how to engage.

Stop treating every website visitor like a hot lead. Start listening for the signals that actually predict a purchase.
